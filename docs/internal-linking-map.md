## Link Anchor Text Guidelines

### Do:
- Use descriptive, relevant anchor text
- Vary anchor text naturally
- Link to the most relevant page
- Prioritize user experience

### Don't:
- Over-optimize anchor text
- Use "click here" or "learn more" alone
- Link the same keyword to different pages
- Add excessive links (2-3 per section is good)

### Examples:

**Good:**
- "Our [heavy-duty pallet racking](/services/heavy-duty-pallet-racking) systems are engineered for..."
- "For operations requiring strict FIFO rotation, consider [pallet flow rack](/resources/racking-types-comparison)..."

**Avoid:**
- "[Click here](/services) to see our services"
- "Learn more about our [services](/services) [services](/services/heavy-duty-pallet-racking) [services](/services/used-pallet-rack)"
