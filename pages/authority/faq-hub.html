            <p><strong>Teardrop</strong> is the most common beam connection pattern in North America. The teardrop-shaped holes in the upright accept clips from various manufacturers, making it largely universal. <strong>Keystone</strong> (and other proprietary patterns) use different hole shapes and are only compatible with specific brands. We primarily stock teardrop-compatible rack for maximum flexibility.</p>

            <p>Yes, quality used rack is absolutely safe when properly inspected and installed. Steel doesn't weaken with age under normal warehouse conditions.
