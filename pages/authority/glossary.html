  <div class="container">
    <h2>Racking Types</h2>

    <div class="glossary-list">
      <div class="glossary-term">
        <h3>Selective Rack (Selective Pallet Rack)</h3>
        <p>The most common type of pallet racking system. Provides direct access to every pallet position from the aisle. Ideal for operations with diverse SKUs that require individual pallet accessibility. Available in roll-formed (bolted) and structural (welded) configurations.</p>
        <p><em>Related: <a href="/services/heavy-duty-pallet-racking">Heavy Duty Pallet Racking</a></em></p>
      </div>

      <div class="glossary-term">
        <h3>Drive-In Rack</h3>
        <p>A high-density storage system where forklifts enter the racking structure to place pallets on rails multiple positions deep. Best for high-volume, low-SKU inventory where LIFO (Last In, First Out) inventory rotation is acceptable. Can increase storage density by 75% compared to selective rack.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="glossary-term">
        <h3>Drive-Through Rack</h3>
        <p>Similar to drive-in rack but accessible from both ends, allowing FIFO (First In, First Out) inventory flow. Forklifts can enter from either side of the rack structure. Less dense than drive-in but provides better inventory rotation.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="glossary-term">
        <h3>Push-Back Rack</h3>
        <p>A dynamic storage system using nested carts on inclined rails. Pallets are loaded from the front aisle; each new pallet pushes the previous ones back. When retrieved, remaining pallets roll forward. Provides high density with LIFO rotation while maintaining aisle accessibility.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="glossary-term">
        <h3>Pallet Flow Rack (Gravity Flow Rack)</h3>
        <p>A dynamic system where pallets are loaded at the back and flow forward on roller conveyors or wheels. Provides automatic FIFO rotation. Often used for date-sensitive inventory like food and beverage products.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="glossary-term">
        <h3>Cantilever Rack</h3>
        <p>A racking system with horizontal arms extending from vertical columns, providing an open front without vertical obstructions. Designed for long, bulky, or irregularly shaped items like lumber, pipes, furniture, and sheet goods.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="glossary-term">
        <h3>Carton Flow Rack</h3>
        <p>Similar to pallet flow but designed for cartons and cases rather than pallets. Uses tilted shelves with rollers or wheels to move products forward. Common in pick/pack operations for order fulfillment.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="glossary-term">
        <h3>Double-Deep Rack</h3>
        <p>Selective racking stored two pallets deep, accessed with a reach truck or double-deep forklift. Provides about 40% more storage than standard selective while maintaining reasonable accessibility. Second pallet position is blocked by the front pallet.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="glossary-term">
        <h3>Structural Rack</h3>
        <p>Pallet racking constructed from hot-rolled structural steel shapes (C-channels, I-beams) with bolted connections. Heavier duty than roll-formed rack. Used in high-impact environments, cold storage, or where maximum durability is required.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="glossary-term">
        <h3>Roll-Formed Rack</h3>
        <p>Pallet racking constructed from cold-rolled steel formed into specific profiles. Lighter and less expensive than structural rack but still rated for substantial loads. The most common type of selective rack in warehouses.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="glossary-term">
        <h3>Narrow Aisle (NA) Rack</h3>
        <p>Racking systems designed for aisles of 8-10 feet, accessed by turret trucks or swing-reach trucks. Increases storage density compared to standard wide-aisle configurations while maintaining selectivity.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="glossary-term">
        <h3>Very Narrow Aisle (VNA) Rack</h3>
        <p>Racking systems with aisles as narrow as 5-6 feet, requiring specialized man-up or wire-guided turret trucks. Maximizes storage density in selective configurations. Often includes guide rails or wire guidance systems.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="glossary-term">
        <h3>Bulk Storage</h3>
        <p>High-volume storage of palletized goods, typically in upper rack levels. Replenishes pick face locations as inventory is depleted.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="glossary-term">
        <h3>Cross-Docking</h3>
        <p>A logistics practice where incoming goods are transferred directly to outbound shipping with minimal storage time. Reduces need for deep storage but may require staging areas.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="glossary-term">
        <h3>Throughput</h3>
        <p>The rate at which goods move through a warehouse, typically measured in pallets per hour or cases per hour. Rack type and layout significantly impact achievable throughput.</p>
